# "Scientific Computing with Python" submissions
This repo contains all the project submissions for the freeCodeCamp.org "Scientific Computing with Python" course:

1. Arithmetic Formatter
2. Time Calculator
3. Budget App
4. Polygon Area Calculator
5. Probability Calculator

Getting my head wrapped around this pythonian non-type phylosophy was not easy at first, this can be seen especially on the variable names I used in the arithmetic formatter.
